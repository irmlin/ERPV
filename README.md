### Cloning the repo

`git clone https://github.com/irmlin/ERPV.git`

### Instructions for launching mobile app (./frontend)
1.  If you don't have Node.js and npm installed, use instructions in https://radixweb.com/blog/installing-npm-and-nodejs-on-windows-and-mac
2.  In project files, go to /frontend folder. Open terminal and run `npm install`. This will install all necessary node.js packages.
3.  Run `npx expo start --tunnel`.
5.  You will see a QR code in the terminal window. Scan this code: if you have an Android phone, download Expo Go app; if you have an iOS, you may use the Camera app. **Note: make sure your computer and phone are connected to the same internet network.**
6.  The app should now be running on your phone. You should see "Hello world!" when launching the initial, unchanged project.
